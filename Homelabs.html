            <h2>A little more on Homelabs</h2>
            <p>Here I figured I could write a little more about how I set up my home network and other things.</p>
            <p>The first modification I did to my homelab was to add my router, so that I could have dedicated routing and not a
                router/modem combo.
            </p>
            <p>The other modification that I've made so far was to add a Raspberry Pi to my network and utilize it as a DNS filter and 
                DHCP server. I used a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, and I downloaded the "DietPi" OS version of Linux. I learned how to use the
                Linux terminal and SSH to remote into the Pi and configure the settings from a different computer on my network. 
            </p>
            <p> One hurtle that I ran into was the configuration of the DHCP server, because I had to shut off the DHCP settings on my router, 
                and I found that that temporarily disable my network until I could get the Pi up and running. I ended up solving by 
                pre-configuring the Pi DHCP and after that was done, logging back into my router to disable it.

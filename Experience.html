    <body><p>I have 5 and a half years of experieence as an industrial mechanic with a focus in machine technologies. I have an advanced
        certificate in machine technologies:millwright that I got from Brazosport college. I have extensive experience working in chemical 
        and oil and gas plants.</p>
        <p> Specifically, I've worked on over-hung API pumps, ANSI pumps, split case,lift, and double-ended pumps. I also have experience 
            working on furnace fans, blowers, and motor replacements (all the way up to 50,000 pound motors!). 
        </p>
        <p>While I don't have professional experience in technology and IT, I thoroughly enjoy working on my home network system and improving
            it where I can. For instance, I have upgraded my modem and bridged it to my router. This way, they can both work independantly of 
            each other and dedicate their usage to routing and modulating signal. I have also set up a Rasberry Pi as a DNS filter and DHCP 
            server on my home network. This way I can browse the web on my home network with very little ads.
        </p>
        <p>I do have some people skills as well. Early in my working career, I was a server at El Chico, a now-closed down restaraunt in my 
            hometown of Lake Jackson, Texas. I learned how to juggle tasks, work efficiently, and keep peoples' time in my section enjoyable 
            with drinks and chips. I learned how to collaborate with others to help make the restaraunt function as well as we could, while 
            also working independantly of everyone to ensure that my guests were taken care of.

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <body>Thank you for visiting my page. My name is John Shirley, but I go by Colt(my middle name). I enjoy playing video games, working on cars, and hanging out with my wife, Zoie.
        In my free time, I like to learn about technology, especially how everything talks with each other. if you check out the navigation bar, you can see some o the projects
        that I've worked on! Go ahead, don't be shy! </body>
